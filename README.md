# Team 5 Advising Project
This is the Advising System Project for Team 5 in CIS 615 at UNA (Spring 2020)

## Description
The Advising System (AS) will be a system that you will build on your own. You are the customer, developer, and project manager. The features that your system has are up to you.

The degree that will be the primary subject of this advising system is the MBA you are currently earning.

The following are some of the high-level features that I have thought of, but are not absolute requirements. 
Those are up to you.
Actors/end-users: advisor, advisee, registrar, admin

Use Cases: create long-term (18 mo, 2 yr) schedule, update class information, add class, delete class, show class info (all, by semester), degree evaluation, list remaining requirements, list/evaluate pre-requisites, EMBA support
