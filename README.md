# Team 5 Advising Project
This is the Advising System Project for Team 5 in CIS 615 at UNA (Spring 2020)

The following are some of the high-level features that I have thought of, but are not absolute requirements. 
Those are up to you.
Actors/end-users: advisor, advisee, registrar, admin

Use Cases: create long-term (18 mo, 2 yr) schedule, update class information, add class, delete class, show class info (all, by semester), degree evaluation, list remaining requirements, list/evaluate pre-requisites, EMBA support
